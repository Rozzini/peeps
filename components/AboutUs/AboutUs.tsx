              The AnonymousPeeps are a mysterious bunch of Peeps who have appeared out of nowhere in
              our dimension! Who they really are is unclear; they don't want to reveal themselves. They
              seem to be coming from the future Metaverse with their digitalization, textures and smooth
              curves all over. Maybe they are famous or possibly the top elite in the crypto space... I guess
              everyone will find out soon enough.

              What we know so far is that they are a collection of 9999+1 NFTs appearing on the Ethereum
              blockchain, stored as an ERC-721 token. We've also heard that they have crazy incentives for
              whoever is lucky enough to catch one.
